# SNHU-a-palooza Concert Series Website

**Final Project – IT 647 Advanced Web Design and Development**

## Overview

This website was developed as the final project for IT 647 and fulfills the city of Woodstock, NY’s requirements for managing the SNHU-a-palooza open concert series. The concerts occur on the first Friday of each month in a farmer’s field, with free admission limited to **50,000 attendees** per event.

To maintain this attendance cap, a digital registration system was created, allowing users to select an individual concert date, register, and receive a printable confirmation with a control number. The system is designed with best practices in user experience, navigation, styling, and responsiveness for both desktop and mobile platforms.
